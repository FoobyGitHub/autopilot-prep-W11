# autopilot-prep-W11

Windows 11 Pro deployment toolkit for Microsoft 365 Business Premium environments. Single PowerShell script, runs from an elevated prompt — nothing to install.

It does three things:

- Prepares a Windows 11 install USB or ISO — forces Pro edition and injects Intel VMD storage drivers where the hardware needs it
- Collects the device hardware hash and saves it locally
- Uploads the hash directly to Intune via Microsoft Graph — no CSV, no manual import

---

## What is the VMD fix and do you need it?

Certain Intel laptops and desktops (11th to 14th gen) use Intel VMD to manage NVMe storage. The standard Windows installer doesn't include the VMD driver — on affected machines, setup either can't see the disk at all, or Windows installs fine but BSODs on first boot with `INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE`.

The script reads the CPU, works out whether the fix is needed, and sorts it automatically. No manual steps, no driver prompts during setup.

**Affected:** Intel 11th gen (Tiger Lake), 12th (Alder Lake), 13th (Raptor Lake), 14th (Arrow Lake), Core Ultra Series 1–2
**Not affected:** Intel 15th gen / Core Ultra Series 3+, AMD, Qualcomm

If you're not on an affected platform the script runs as normal — the VMD steps are just skipped.

---

## Running the script on a different machine

Auto-detection works by querying the hardware on the machine running the script. If you are prepping a USB or patching an ISO on a separate PC — which is common, especially for `-PatchISO` — the target machine's hardware won't be visible.

In that case, use `-ForceWiFi` to inject the Wi-Fi/BT drivers unconditionally, regardless of what's detected on the prep machine.

VMD detection also uses the CPU of the machine running the script. If you are prepping on a different machine, use `-ForceVMD` to inject the VMD driver unconditionally. For a full cross-machine prep — covering both VMD storage and Wi-Fi/BT — combine the flags:

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FoobyGitHub/autopilot-prep-W11/main/Invoke-AutopilotSetup.ps1))) -PrepUSB -ForceVMD -ForceWiFi
```

---

## Quick start

Open PowerShell as Administrator (right-click → Run as administrator) and copy the command you need.

**Collect hardware hash** — plug in a spare USB first, the script saves to it automatically:

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FoobyGitHub/autopilot-prep-W11/main/Invoke-AutopilotSetup.ps1))) -CollectHash
```

**Prep a Windows 11 USB** — auto-detects the USB, handles Pro edition and VMD driver injection:

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FoobyGitHub/autopilot-prep-W11/main/Invoke-AutopilotSetup.ps1))) -PrepUSB
```

**Prep USB on a specific drive letter:**

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FoobyGitHub/autopilot-prep-W11/main/Invoke-AutopilotSetup.ps1))) -PrepUSB -DriveLetter E
```

**Both at once:**

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FoobyGitHub/autopilot-prep-W11/main/Invoke-AutopilotSetup.ps1))) -PrepUSB -CollectHash
```

**Pre-stage a patched ISO** — file and folder pickers open automatically:

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FoobyGitHub/autopilot-prep-W11/main/Invoke-AutopilotSetup.ps1))) -PatchISO
```

**No flags** — prints a help screen with all options and the above commands ready to copy.

## Deployment workflows

There are two ways to get a prepped Windows 11 USB. Pick whichever suits your situation.

### Option A — Prep an existing USB (-PrepUSB)

For one-off builds or when you already have a USB to hand. Create the USB with Rufus first, then run `-PrepUSB` to inject Pro edition config and VMD drivers.

> **Use Rufus, not the Microsoft Media Creation Tool.** MCT creates USBs in ESD format — the VMD driver can't be injected into `install.wim` on an ESD USB. Boot disk detection will still be fixed, but the installed OS may BSOD on first boot on VMD-affected machines. Rufus creates WIM-format USBs which work properly.

**Creating the USB with [Rufus](https://rufus.ie):**

1. Download the Windows 11 ISO from [microsoft.com/software-download/windows11](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11)
2. Plug in a USB drive (8 GB minimum)
3. Open Rufus and select the USB drive
4. Click **SELECT** and pick the Windows 11 ISO
5. When asked about **"Windows User Experience"** — leave everything unchecked and click **OK**
6. Leave all other settings as they are and click **START**
7. Confirm the USB will be wiped and wait for Rufus to finish

Once done, plug the USB into any PC with internet access and run `-PrepUSB`. The script picks it up automatically.

**What -PrepUSB does:**

1. Injects `ei.cfg` → forces Pro edition at setup, no edition selection screen
2. Detects the CPU → determines whether VMD injection is needed
3. If needed, downloads the VMD driver from this repo and injects it into `boot.wim` (so setup can see the disk) and all indexes in `install.wim` (so the installed OS can boot)

If you are prepping the USB on a different machine to the one being built, the CPU won't match the target and VMD may be skipped. Use `-ForceVMD` to inject regardless:

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FoobyGitHub/autopilot-prep-W11/main/Invoke-AutopilotSetup.ps1))) -PrepUSB -ForceVMD
```

### 4. Injects Wi-Fi and Bluetooth drivers (if Intel BE201 detected)

If the machine running the script has an Intel BE201 (Wi-Fi 7) adapter, the script also injects the WLAN and Bluetooth drivers into both boot.wim and install.wim. This covers machines where Windows setup or first boot may not have inbox support for the BE201. Detection is automatic — if the adapter isn't present the step is skipped silently.

If you are prepping the USB on a different machine to the one being built, auto-detection won't work — the adapter won't be present. Use `-ForceWiFi` to inject the drivers regardless:

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FoobyGitHub/autopilot-prep-W11/main/Invoke-AutopilotSetup.ps1))) -PrepUSB -ForceWiFi
```

Same applies to `-PatchISO -ForceWiFi`.

### Option B — Pre-stage a golden ISO (-PatchISO)

Better for repeated deployments. Patch a Windows 11 ISO once on a fast machine, then burn it to as many USBs as you need — no per-USB script run required.

The ISO can also be hosted centrally (file share, Azure Blob, etc.) so the team is always burning from the same known-good image.

**Requirements:** Windows ADK Deployment Tools — installed automatically if not present (~200MB download). A 10-second warning is shown before anything is downloaded.

**Run:**

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FoobyGitHub/autopilot-prep-W11/main/Invoke-AutopilotSetup.ps1))) -PatchISO
```

A file picker opens for the source ISO, then a folder picker for the output location. The script does the rest — Pro edition config, VMD injection into both WIM files, and repacks to a new `.iso` file. Burn the output with Rufus.

## Collecting the hardware hash

Plug a spare USB into the device and run `-CollectHash`. The hash is saved to `AutopilotHashes\autopilot-<hostname>.csv` on the USB. You can run this on multiple machines with the same USB — each device writes its own file.

If no spare USB is found, the file saves to the Public Desktop instead.

### Uploading to Intune

The script can upload the hash to Intune automatically via Microsoft Graph. There are two ways to authenticate:

**Device code (default — no setup needed)**

After collecting the hash, the script prints a short code and the URL `https://microsoft.com/devicelogin`. Open that URL in any browser, enter the code, and sign in with an account that has `DeviceManagementServiceConfig.ReadWrite.All` (delegated) in Microsoft Graph. The hash is uploaded once you authenticate.

If the upload fails or times out, the CSV is saved locally and the script tells you where it is and how to import it manually.

**Certificate auth (unattended — for automation)**

> Untested. [Raise an issue](https://github.com/FoobyGitHub/autopilot-prep-W11/issues) if you hit problems.

Requires an Entra ID App Registration with `DeviceManagementServiceConfig.ReadWrite.All` as an **application** permission (not delegated), and a certificate uploaded to the registration. The certificate private key needs to be in the local machine cert store on the machine running the script.

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FoobyGitHub/autopilot-prep-W11/main/Invoke-AutopilotSetup.ps1))) -CollectHash -TenantId "your-tenant-id" -AppClientId "your-app-client-id" -AppCertThumbprint "your-cert-thumbprint"
```

**Setting up the App Registration:**

1. Entra ID → App registrations → New registration — name it something like `Autopilot Hash Upload`
2. API permissions → Add → Microsoft Graph → Application permissions → `DeviceManagementServiceConfig.ReadWrite.All` → Grant admin consent
3. Certificates & secrets → Certificates → upload your certificate public key (`.cer` file)
4. Note the Application (client) ID and your tenant ID
5. Install the certificate with its private key into the local machine cert store on the prep machine

**Manual import (if not using Graph upload):**

1. Open [Intune admin centre](https://intune.microsoft.com)
2. Devices → Enroll devices → Windows enrollment → Devices
3. Import → upload the CSV
4. Allow 5–15 minutes for the device to appear

---

## Full deployment steps

1. On the device being enrolled — run `-CollectHash` (plug in a USB first). The hash is saved to the USB or uploaded to Intune automatically.
2. On a separate machine — prep the install USB using Option A (`-PrepUSB`) or create a patched ISO using Option B (`-PatchISO`) and burn it with Rufus.
3. Boot the target device from the USB. Delete existing partitions if doing a clean install.
4. Windows 11 Pro installs — no edition prompt, no driver prompts.
5. At OOBE, connect to the internet. If the device hash is registered in Intune, Autopilot takes over automatically.
6. The user signs in with their work account and Intune enrols the device.

## Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| Licence | Microsoft 365 Business Premium (includes Windows 11 Pro) |
| PowerShell | 5.1 or later (inbox on all supported Windows versions) |
| Elevation | Must run as Administrator |

## Notes

- The script sets execution policy to `RemoteSigned` for the current user automatically — no need to sort this manually beforehand.
- The hardware hash CSV contains serial number, Windows product ID, and hardware hash only — no personal data.
- If a device was previously registered in Autopilot under a different tenant, deregister it there first before importing the hash.
